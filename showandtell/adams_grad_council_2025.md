# Building Inclusive Graduate Communities Through Student Orientation

## MPA Program's Approach to New Student Engagement

**David P. Adams, Ph.D.**  
Associate Professor & MPA Program Director  
California State University, Fullerton

---

## Evolution of Our Approach

### From Crisis to Community

- **Fall 2020 – Spring 2023**: Zoom orientations (pandemic necessity)  
- **Fall 2023 – Present**: Intentional in-person design  
- **Key Shift**: From information delivery to community building

> "We don't just orient students to the program — we orient them to each other"

---

## Theoretical Foundation

### Project UpGrads Training

- Establishing culturally responsive relationships with graduate students
- Supporting first-generation students using community-building strategies
- Creating inclusive spaces for diverse graduate populations

### Core Principle

**Graduate education succeeds through community, not just curriculum**

---

## Who We Invite: Expanding the Circle

### Beyond Just New Students

- New students (primary audience)
- Current students (peer mentors)
- Recent alumni (near-peer role models)
- Family members & loved ones (support systems)
- Available faculty (visible commitment)

<blockquote>“Your success is our collective success”</blockquote>

## The Orientation Structure

### Large Group → Breakouts → Reconvene

<div class="card">
<strong>Morning Agenda</strong>

1. <span class="accent">Welcome Together</span> (30 min)  
     - Introductions & program values  
     - Why CSUF MPA?
2. <span class="accent">Strategic Breakouts</span> (45 min)
3. <span class="accent">Reunite & Resources</span> (30 min)  
     - Campus support systems  
     - All‑participant Q&A

## The Breakout Innovation

### Two Parallel Tracks

**Track 1: New Students**
- **Faculty intros** – meet your mentors
- **Curriculum** – course sequencing
- **Milestones** – key checkpoints
- **Scholarships** – funding options

**Track 2: Support Network**
- **Supporting students** – practical help
- **Navigating together** – expectations
- **Success strategies** – alumni tips
- **Understanding** – the journey ahead

## Creating Inclusive Spaces

### Practical Inclusion Strategies

- **Saturday 10am timing** — accessible for working professionals  
- **Food & beverages** — breaking bread builds bonds  
- **Children welcome** — "Bring kids if needed" (removes barriers)  
- **Multiple perspectives** — students hear from peers, not just faculty  
- **Support system engagement** — family understanding reduces stress

<small class="muted">Small gestures, significant impact</small>

---

## Building Community Through Design

### Intentional Connections

- **Faculty presence** — core faculty attend (commitment visible)  
- **Peer connections** — current students share real experiences  
- **Alumni stories** — recent grads provide hope and concrete examples  
- **Family involvement** — creates informed support networks

**Result**: Students leave with relationships, not just information

---

## Early Observations

### Anecdotal Feedback Themes

**From Students Who Experienced Both Formats:**

- "I actually met people I'll study with"
- "My partner finally understands what I'm doing"
- "Seeing successful alumni made it feel achievable"

**From Current Students as Mentors:**

- "I wish we'd had this"
- "Helping orient others reinforced my own belonging"

---

## Why This Matters

### Graduate Student Challenges

- **Isolation** — evening programs, commuter campus  
- **Imposter syndrome** — first-gen, career changers  
- **Support gaps** — families don't understand the journey  
- **Time scarcity** — working professionals juggling responsibilities

### Our Response

**Build community from day one, don't wait and hope it emerges**

---

## Lessons for Adaptation

### Key Principles for Other Programs

1. Invite the village — include support systems  
2. Create parallel programming — different audiences, simultaneous value  
3. Remove barriers — time, food, childcare considerations  
4. Show commitment — faculty attendance matters  
5. Foster peer connections — current students as bridges

---

## Next Steps: Assessment

### Moving from Anecdote to Evidence

**Current Data Collection**

- Pre/post orientation surveys (belonging, confidence, connections)
- Alignment with program SLOs
- DEIB plan metrics
- Longitudinal tracking (retention, engagement)

**Goal**: Evidence-based model for inclusive graduate orientation

## Questions & Discussion

### Let's Talk About Your Experiences

- What orientation challenges do you face?  
- How do you build graduate community?  
- What barriers prevent family/support system engagement?
